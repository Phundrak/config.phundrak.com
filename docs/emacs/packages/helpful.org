** Bufler
Bufler is a package that organises and lists buffers in a much better
way than how they are usually sorted. You can easily and quickly find
buffers by their group, not only by their name, and THIS is great
news! Also, no ~helm~ please! And for some reason, the keybindings are
borked by default, so let’s redefine them, and let’s also rebind ~SPC~
to ~p~ since it would conflict with my main ~general~ prefix.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package bufler
  :straight (bufler :build t
                    :files (:defaults (:exclude "helm-bufler.el")))
  :defer t
  :general
  (phundrak/evil
   :keymaps  'bufler-list-mode-map
   :packages 'bufler
   "?"   #'hydra:bufler/body
   "g"   #'bufler
   "f"   #'bufler-list-group-frame
   "F"   #'bufler-list-group-make-frame
   "N"   #'bufler-list-buffer-name-workspace
   "k"   #'bufler-list-buffer-kill
   "p"   #'bufler-list-buffer-peek
   "s"   #'bufler-list-buffer-save
   "RET" #'bufler-list-buffer-switch))

** Helpful
As the name tells, =helpful= is a really helpful package which greatly
enhances a couple of built-in functions from Emacs, namely:
| Vanilla Emacs Function | Helpful Function | Comment                                       |
|------------------------+------------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| =describe-function=      | =helpful-callable= | Only interactive functions                    |
| =describe-function=      | =helpful-function= | Only actual functions (including interactive) |
| =describe-function=      | =helpful-macro=    |                                               |
| =describe-command=       | =helpful-command=  |                                               |
| =describe-key=           | =helpful-key=      |                                               |
| =describe-variable=      | =helpful-variable= |                                               |
