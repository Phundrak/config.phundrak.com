* PROJECTNAME

PROJECTNAME is a C11 project written for and built with CMake.

* How to build PROJECTNAME

You can directly run either ~make~ or ~make release~ to compile the release
version of the binaries which will be generated in ~bin/~. If you wish to
compile its debug version instead, run ~make debug~ to generate the binaries in
the ~debug/~ directory. Once you have ran ~make~ at the root of the project, you
can recompile the project from the ~build/~ directory if you wish to avoid to
re-run CMake.
