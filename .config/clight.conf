## Note that if clight is started outside of an event, correct gamma temperature
## will be immediately setted using normal parameters:

## Let screen temperature match ambient brightness, like monitor backlight.
## When enabled, screen temperature won't be changed time-based.
## Note that it uses same curve points as backlight.
## Note also that LOCATION is still needed to let BACKLIGHT module know current time of day.
## Finally, it requires BACKLIGHT module to be enabled, otherwise it gets disabled.

## Use this feature to provide screen-emitted brightness compensation to Clight.                             #
## The idea here is:                                                                                         #
##      dark ambient    -> higher monitor light contribution impact                                          #
##      bright ambient  -> lower monitor light contribution impact                                           #
## But, at the same time, obviously (as that is clight main feature):                                        #
##      dark ambient    -> lower monitor backlight level    -> lower monitor light contribution impact       #
##      high ambient    -> high monitor backlight level     -> higher monitor light contribution impact      #
## We can assume these 2 contributions to zero each other, letting us just compute screen-emitted brightness #
## and linearly multiplying it for our guessed ambient-brightness screen contribution value.                 #
