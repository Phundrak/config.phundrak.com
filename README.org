* P’undrak’s dotfiles

** Presentation

   This is my collection of dotfiles for my daily GNU/Linux environment, tweaked
   to  my liking.  If  you  wish to  get  the same  setup  as  mine, follow  the
   instructions below.

   As you can see, I personally use [[https://fishshell.com/][fish]]  as my shell of choice, and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] using
   [[http://spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]] (still with Emacs keybinding) as my main text editor.

   I also use  [[https://github.com/resloved/i3][Resloved]]’s [[https://github.com/resloved/i3][fork]] of [[https://github.com/Airblader/i3][i3-gaps]] with two  [[https://github.com/jaagr/polybar][polybar]] bars and [[https://github.com/tryone144][Tryone144]]’s
   [[https://github.com/tryone144/compton][fork]] of  [[https://github.com/chjj/compton][Compton]]. The colors  scheme for [[https://github.com/davatorium/rofi][rofi]],  Emacs and polybar  are chosen
   from the wallpapers using [[https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal][pywal]].

** Features

   - Emacs configuration perfectly tailored for my own use
   - Beautiful and comfy i3 and polybar configuration

** Dependencies

   Of course, some dependencies are needed for my dotfiles to work well. Here is
   a non-exhaustive list of software needed by these configuration files:
   - Emacs >= 26.2
     - Spacemacs (develop branch)
   - fish
   - [[https://st.suckless.org/][st]] ([[https://github.com/mattiadr][Mattiadr]]’s [[https://github.com/mattiadr/st][fork]])
   - i3-gaps
   - compton
   - pywal
   - j4-dmenu-desktop
   - minted
   - Rust nightly
   - texlive-core
   And some other stuff scattered around in my dotfiles.

   I also use my own layer for conlanging when within org-mode in Emacs, you can
   find it [[https://labs.phundrak.fr/phundrak/conlang-layer][here]]. I also use [[https://github.com/venmos][Venmos]]’ [[https://github.com/venmos/w3m-layer][w3m layer]].

** Installation

   To have the same install as I  do, simply symlink your configuration files to
   the files in this git repository.

** Licence

   All of my dotfiles  (and my dotfiles only) are available  under the GNU GPLv3
   Licence. Please consult  [[file:LICENCE.md]] for more information.  In short: you
   are free to access,  edit and redistribute all of my  dotfiles under the same
