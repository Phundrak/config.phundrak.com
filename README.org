  This is my collection of dotfiles  for my daily GNU/Linux environment, tweaked
  to  my  liking. If  you  wish  to  get the  same  setup  as mine,  follow  the
  instructions below.

  As you can see,  I personally use [[https://fishshell.com/][fish]] as my shell of  choice, and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] using
  [[http://spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]] (still with Emacs keybinding) as my main text editor.

  I also  use [[https://github.com/resloved/i3][Resloved]]’s [[https://github.com/resloved/i3][fork]] of  [[https://github.com/Airblader/i3][i3-gaps]] with two [[https://github.com/jaagr/polybar][polybar]]  bars and [[https://github.com/tryone144][Tryone144]]’s
  [[https://github.com/tryone144/compton][fork]] of [[https://github.com/chjj/compton][Compton]]. The colors scheme for [[https://github.com/davatorium/rofi][rofi]], Emacs and polybar are chosen from
  the wallpapers using [[https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal][pywal]].

  - Emacs configuration perfectly tailored for my own use
  - Beautiful and comfy i3 and polybar configuration
  - And enough information  below to get basically the same  distro install as I
    have on my main computer and my travel laptop.

  Most of the org  files you will find in this repos are  the actual source code
  of  much   of  my  config  files.   For  instance,  the  bootstrap   found  in
  [[file:installation.org][installation.org]]   exports    almost   all    of   its   code    snippets   to
  [[file:.config/yadm/bootstrap][.config/yadm/bootstrap]]  thanks to  =M-x org-babel-tangle=  from within  Emacs.
  Below I will also  present and comment some of my short  config files which do
  not deserve to have a full org file dedicated to them.

** Custom scripts in =PATH=
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-d582e107-fa66-4f79-869e-2b49116ed1ec
   :END:
   I have written some scripts that  help me daily accomplish some simple tasks,
   like mounting  and unmounting a drive  or Android device, an  emoji picker, a
   utility to  set up my Wacom  tablet, and so on.  You can find them  stored in
   [[file:.local/bin/README.org][.local/bin]] along with their detailed explanation  in the README placed in the
   same folder —which is actually their  source code once the org-mode file gets
   tangled.

** Emacs configuration
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-f6d2561f-5c02-4540-8287-4acf3037b3d5
   :END:
   Emacs is my main text editor, which I use for almost everything. Because, you
   know…
   #+begin_quote
   Emacs is a great operating system, it just lacks a good text editor.
   #+end_quote
   You can find my Emacs config, based  on Spacemacs, in my [[https://labs.phundrak.com/phundrak/dotfiles/src/branch/master/.spacemacs][.spacemacs]] file, and
   my user configuration in my [[file:~/org/config-website/spacemacs.org][spacemacs.org]] file.

** Email signature
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-f6c48286-a320-493f-b330-ee0a697e6d79
   :HEADER-ARGS: :tangle ~/.signature
   :END:
   This file gets inserted automatically at the end of my emails.
   #+BEGIN_SRC text
     Lucien “Phundrak” Cartier-Tilet
     https://phundrak.com (Français)
     https://en.phundrak.com (English)

     Pensez à notre planète, avez-vous vraiment besoin d’imprimer ce courriel ?
     Please mind our planet, do you really need to print this email?
   #+END_SRC

** Fish configuration with useful abbreviations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-f35ed9a3-c9fc-458c-8a62-693f679f6992
   :END:
   You can also find  in my Fish shell configuration in  my [[file:~/org/config-website/fish.org][fish.org]] file, which
   contains my usual abbreviations.

** Global gitignore
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-4f92eb29-7cfa-48ec-b39d-39037ace3682
   :HEADER-ARGS: :tangle ~/.gitignore_global
   :END:
   Sometimes,  there are  some lines  that  always reappear  in gitignores.  So,
   instead of  always adding  them, let  git now  that some  elements are  to be
   ignored by default, hence the  [[file:.gitignore_global][~/.gitignore_global]] file. First, we don’t want
   nano’s backup files.
   #+BEGIN_SRC text
     ~*
   #+END_SRC

   And output binaries generated by =gcc= and the likes aren’t welcome either.
   #+BEGIN_SRC text
     ,*.out
   #+END_SRC

** i3 configuration
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-c918e370-d867-412c-8b0e-078e4e3772e0
   :END:
   The i3  configuration is detailed in  its corresponding README which  you can
   find at [[file:.config/i3/README.org][.config/i3/README.org]].

** Nano
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h-1724166b-55b7-4a64-9ff1-47c2a9e76f46
  :END:
  Although  it  is  a very  simple  piece  of  software,  nano does  offer  some
  customization. Mine can be found in my [[file:~/org/config-website/nano.org][nano.org]] file.

** Rustfmt
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-0ae9005c-76a6-49f6-947c-0c8464616e10
   :HEADER-ARGS: :tangle ~/.rustfmt.toml
   :END:
   In my  [[file:.rustfmt.toml][.rustfmt.toml]], you  can find  some custom  rules on  how my  Rust code
   should be formatted.

   First, we are using the 2018 edition of Rust.
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
   edition = "2018"
   #+END_SRC

   The maximum length of enum  variant having discriminant, that gets vertically
   aligned with others. Variants without  discriminants would be ignored for the
   purpose of alignment.

   Note  that this  is not  how  much whitespace  is inserted,  but instead  the
   longest variant name that doesn't get ignored when aligning.
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
   enum_discrim_align_threshold = 20
   #+END_SRC

   Put single-expression functions on a single line.
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
   fn_single_line = true
   #+END_SRC

   Format code snippet included in doc comments.
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
   format_code_in_doc_comments = true
   #+END_SRC

   Format string literals where necessary.
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
   format_strings = true
   #+END_SRC

   Use tab characters for indentation, spaces for alignment.
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
   hard_tabs = true
   #+END_SRC

   Maximum width of each line
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
   max_width = 80
   #+END_SRC

   Merge multiple imports into a single nested import.
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
   merge_imports = true
   #+END_SRC

   My newline style will always be Unix.
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
   newline_style = Unix
   #+END_SRC

   Convert =/* */= comments to =//= comments where possible.
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
   normalize_comments = true
   #+END_SRC

   Convert =#![doc]= and =#[doc]= attributes to =//!= and =///= doc comments.
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
   normalize_doc_attributes = true
   #+END_SRC

   Reorder  impl items.  =type=  and  =const= are  put  first,  then macros  and
   methods.
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
   reorder_impl_items = true
   #+END_SRC

   Report =FIXME= items in comments.
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
   report_fixme = "Always"
   #+END_SRC

   Report =TODO= items in comments.
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
   todo = "Always"
   #+END_SRC

   The  maximum diff  of width  between struct  fields to  be aligned  with each
   other.
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
   struct_field_align_threshold = 20
   #+END_SRC

   Number of spaces per tab.
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
   tab_spaces = 2
   #+END_SRC

   Break comments to fit on the line.
   #+BEGIN_SRC toml
   wrap_comments = true
   #+END_SRC

** Tmux configuration
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-4f48b912-b67b-4549-a671-802e76221f46
   :END:
   You can find  my tmux configuration in [[file:tmux.org][tmux.org]]. It  depends on the submodule
   [[https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux.git][.tmux]] by [[https://pempek.net/][Gregory Pakosz]].

** Xresources
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-e6f48975-3b86-4a75-a7e5-5cc9edbd9869
   :HEADER-ARGS: :tangle ~/.Xresources :exports code
   :END:
   My Xresources file is very short. Indeed, it only contains two lines which
   are dedicated to my =st= terminal to set its font and shell. The font is set
   as follows.
   #+BEGIN_SRC conf
     st.font: Source Code Pro for Powerline:style=book
   #+END_SRC
   And I will set my shell like this:
   #+BEGIN_SRC conf
     st.shell: /usr/bin/fish
   #+END_SRC

   I used to have lines dedicated to UXTerm and URxvt, but I cast them out of my
   system.

* Dependencies
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h-5849dbcf-a650-4323-9a90-bec549a7b982

  And some other stuff scattered around in my dotfiles.

  BTW, I use Arch.

  [[file:installation.org][installation.org]] file  where I  walk you  through the  first manual  steps and
  through the bootstrap you  can execute to automatically take care  of a lot of
  elements.
