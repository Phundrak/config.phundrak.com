* Introduction

  Ncmpcpp is a TUI front-end for MPD, with  an UI very similar to Ncmpc. This is
  my  main  MPD  front-end after  my  i3  shortcuts.  You  can find  below  some
  screenshots of how my current ncmpcpp configuration looks like.

* Core Ncmpcpp settings
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h-02b8e820-d12d-479f-a856-86121eccab96
  :END:
  #+BEGIN_SRC conf :exports none

** Directories
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-0da83a89-b409-4e48-9bd7-3db9afed4945
   :END:
   Ncmpcpp  has  two  vital  directories:  the lyrics  directory,  and  its  own
   configuration directory. The configuration for ncmpcpp is generally either in
   ~$HOME/.ncmpcpp/~ or in ~$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ncmpcpp/~.
   #+BEGIN_SRC conf
     ncmpcpp_directory = ~/.config/ncmpcpp
   #+END_SRC

   When  it comes  to the  lyrics, be  sure  to set  the directory  to the  same
   directory pointed at by Mpd.
   #+BEGIN_SRC conf
     lyrics_directory = ~/.lyrics
   #+END_SRC

** MPD
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-cc81e6db-7418-4823-b2b4-4c3f1e842eaa
   :END:
   These settings tell ncmpcpp how to  communicate with Mpd. Once again, be sure
   to follow your own MPD settings. In my  case, I am connecting to my local MPD
   server, hence  the ~localhost~  value of  the variable below,  and I  did not
   change the default port of MPD. My music is located at =~/Music=, and ncmpcpp
   should  connect pretty  much immediately,  although  I allow  a five  seconds
   timeout before ncmpcpp treats it as an error. Also, no crossfade please.
   #+BEGIN_SRC conf
     mpd_host = localhost
     mpd_port = 6600
     mpd_music_dir = ~/Music
     mpd_connection_timeout = 5
     mpd_crossfade_time = 0
   #+END_SRC
