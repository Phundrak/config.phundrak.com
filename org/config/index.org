  This is my collection of dotfiles  for my daily GNU/Linux environment, tweaked
  to  my  liking. If  you  wish  to  get the  same  setup  as mine,  follow  the
  instructions below.

  As you can see, I personally use [[https://fishshell.com/][fish]] as my shell of choice, and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] 27.0.90
  (custom build) using [[http://spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]] (still with Emacs keybinding in Insert mode but
  with Evil in Normal mode) as my main text editor.

  When it  comes to  my graphical  UI, I  do not  have any  desktop environment.
  Instead,  I have  two  tiling  window managers.  The  historical  first on  my
  configuration is [[https://github.com/Airblader/i3][i3-gaps]],  an [[https://i3wm.org/][i3]] fork by  [[https://github.com/Airblader/i3][Airblader]] with which I  use two bars
  generated  by  [[https://polybar.github.io/][Polybar]]. My  other  TWM,  and the  one  I  use most  often,  is
  [[https://awesomewm.org/][AwesomeWM]]. Both TWMs use [[https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal][pywal]] to define their color scheme, as well as [[https://github.com/davatorium/rofi][rofi]]’s
  color scheme.

  Finally, you  can find my  configuration for my  Ergodox keyboard [[https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/5WrVw/latest/0][here]].  It is
  optimized for  usage with the  Bépo layout set as  a software layout,  and for
  shortcuts from i3.

  :END:
  - Emacs configuration perfectly tailored for my own use
  - Beautiful and comfy i3 and polybar configuration
  - And enough information  below to get basically the same  distro install as I
    have on my main computer and my travel laptop.

  Most of the org  files you will find in this repos are  the actual source code
  of  much   of  my  config  files.   For  instance,  the  bootstrap   found  in
  [[file:installation.org][installation.org]]   exports    almost   all    of   its   code    snippets   to
  [[file:.config/yadm/bootstrap][.config/yadm/bootstrap]]  thanks to  =M-x org-babel-tangle=  from within  Emacs.
  Below I will also  present and comment some of my short  config files which do
  not deserve to have a full org file dedicated to them.

** Tiling Window Managers
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-b70d9b3b-4259-4311-aa23-4792656220bb
   :END:
*** AwesomeWM
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h-dbfc71a0-9d96-4f53-a064-f8d6f9567813
    :END:
    AwesomeWM is the TWM I use the most on my computer between itself and i3. My
    configuration for it is documented  in detail in its corresponding document,
    which you can find [[file:awesome.org][here]].

*** i3 configuration
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h-c918e370-d867-412c-8b0e-078e4e3772e0
    :END:
    The i3 configuration  is detailed in its corresponding README  which you can
    find [[file:i3.org][here]].

** Graphical tweaks
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-08018a9b-f0c8-4bff-b18d-834ec0dc11a8
   :END:
*** Picom
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h-c539fde3-3f1a-4855-8d63-28729ed806a5
    :END:
    Picom is  a standalone compositor  for Xorg,  and the successor  to Compton,
    itself successor to  xcompmgr-dana, itself a fork of xcompmgr.  You can find
    my Picom configuration [[file:picom.org][here]].

*** Xresources
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h-e6f48975-3b86-4a75-a7e5-5cc9edbd9869
    :HEADER-ARGS: :tangle ~/.Xresources :exports code
    :END:
    My Xresources file  is very short. Indeed, it only  contains two lines which
    are dedicated to my =st= terminal to set its font and shell. The font is set
    as follows.
    #+BEGIN_SRC conf
      st.font: Source Code Pro for Powerline:style=book
    #+END_SRC
    And I will set my shell like this:
    #+BEGIN_SRC conf
      st.shell: /usr/bin/fish
    #+END_SRC
    I can also set the transparency of st (my terminal emulator) like so:
    #+BEGIN_SRC conf
      st.alpha: 0.7
    #+END_SRC

    I used to have  lines dedicated to UXTerm and URxvt, but I  cast them out of
    my system.

** Text and source code editing
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-2730f882-e775-41a3-b169-5049c142cc54
   :END:
*** Emacs configuration
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h-f6d2561f-5c02-4540-8287-4acf3037b3d5
    :END:
    Emacs is  my main text editor,  which I use for  almost everything. Because,
    you know…
    #+begin_quote
    Emacs is a great operating system, it just lacks a good text editor.
    #+end_quote

    You can find my Emacs config, based on Spacemacs, in my [[https://labs.phundrak.com/phundrak/dotfiles/src/branch/master/.spacemacs][.spacemacs]] file, and
    my user configuration in my [[file:spacemacs.org][spacemacs.org]] file.

*** Nano
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h-1724166b-55b7-4a64-9ff1-47c2a9e76f46
    :END:
    Although  it is  a  very simple  piece  of software,  nano  does offer  some
    customization. Mine can be found in my [[file:~/org/config-website/nano.org][nano.org]] file.

*** Rustfmt
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h-0ae9005c-76a6-49f6-947c-0c8464616e10
    :END:
    You can find my Rustfmt configuration [[file:rustfmt.org][here]].

** Custom scripts in =PATH=
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-d582e107-fa66-4f79-869e-2b49116ed1ec
   :END:
   I have written some scripts that  help me daily accomplish some simple tasks,
   like mounting  and unmounting a drive  or Android device, an  emoji picker, a
   utility to  set up my Wacom  tablet, and so on.  You can find them  stored in
   [[file:.local/bin/README.org][.local/bin]] along with their detailed explanation  in the README placed in the
   same folder —which is actually their  source code once the org-mode file gets
   tangled.

** Fish configuration with useful abbreviations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-f35ed9a3-c9fc-458c-8a62-693f679f6992
   :END:
   You can also find  in my Fish shell configuration in  my [[file:~/org/config-website/fish.org][fish.org]] file, which
   contains my usual abbreviations.

** And some minor configuration files
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-1a819f94-ab79-41e6-9509-a2781ab10b79
   :END:
*** Email signature
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h-f6c48286-a320-493f-b330-ee0a697e6d79
    :HEADER-ARGS: :tangle ~/.signature
    :END:
    This file gets inserted automatically at the end of my emails.
    #+BEGIN_SRC text
      Lucien “Phundrak” Cartier-Tilet
      https://phundrak.com (Français)
      https://en.phundrak.com (English)

      Sent from a Free and Open-Source Linux operating system with GNU/Emacs
    #+END_SRC

*** Global gitignore
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h-4f92eb29-7cfa-48ec-b39d-39037ace3682
    :HEADER-ARGS: :tangle ~/.gitignore_global
    :END:
    Sometimes,  there are  some lines  that always  reappear in  gitignores. So,
    instead of  always adding  them, let git  now that some  elements are  to be
    ignored by default, hence the [[file:.gitignore_global][~/.gitignore_global]] file. First, we don’t want
    nano’s backup files.
    #+BEGIN_SRC text
      ~*
    #+END_SRC

    And object files and output binaries generated by =gcc= and the likes aren’t
    welcome either.
    #+BEGIN_SRC text
      ,*.out
      ,*.o
    #+END_SRC

** Tmux configuration
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-4f48b912-b67b-4549-a671-802e76221f46
   :END:
   You can find  my tmux configuration in [[file:tmux.org][tmux.org]]. It  depends on the submodule
   [[https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux.git][.tmux]] by [[https://pempek.net/][Gregory Pakosz]].

* Dependencies
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h-5849dbcf-a650-4323-9a90-bec549a7b982

  And some other stuff scattered around in my dotfiles.

  BTW, I use Arch.

* Installation

  For an  installation walkthrough of my  Arch Linux installation, check  out my
  [[file:installation.org][installation.org]] file  where I  walk you  through the  first manual  steps and
  through the bootstrap you  can execute to automatically take care  of a lot of
  elements.
